## Week 7 - Python Basics

Welcome to **Week 7** of my 9-week web dev program — and the official start of my Python journey!
We kicked things off by installing Python on our laptops, navigating to Windows-SSD (C:) and getting hands-on in actual code files.
This wasn't just about writing `print("Hello World")` — we went deeper.

## What's Inside?

The `Python` folder holds all 11 `.py` files I worked on across multiple lessons.
I renamed them by lesson to keep track, because the instructor reused the same filename but changed topics — and I wasn't about to lose track!
Files include:
* `hello_world.py`
* `python.py` through `python_6.1.py`
* `strings.py`, `strings_2`

---

## What We Covered

* **Strings & string manipulation** (including advanced string slicing)
* **Variables** — assigning and working with different data types
* **Numeric data** — operations, arithmetic, and comparisons
* **Control statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* **Loops** — `for` and `while` in action

---

## Format & Flow

* Tutorial-based learning
* Pure `.py` files written directly in the Python app
* No interactivity (no buttons or front-end) — just terminal-based outputs

---

## Why So Many Files?

Each lesson built on the previous one — but the tutorial reused the filename.
So I split things up as:

> One concept = One clearly-named file
  For example:

* `strings_2.py` = where we learned that we can access individual characters within a string by using indexing
* `python_5.1.py` = explored comparisons and control statements
